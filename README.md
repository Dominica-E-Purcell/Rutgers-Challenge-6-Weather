## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I set myself the goal of trying to work with Materialize and getting a deeper understanding of the local storage. 
I wanted to build a fun bright website that would pop. Most of the weather sites I have ever seen are either vascillate between austre plain jane and extremely complex. I didn't get to implement all of the ideas that I had but this is a good start to jump off of in the future.
This site gives a bright fun weather report on different cities. Whether a person wants to create a list of places that they have visted or are constructing a bucket list of future adventures this is menat to bring a little brightness to weather. Afterall they universal awkward conversation 'starter' could always use a little enlivening.
I got to use a CSS framework with Materialize. This was more kismet than the assignment as we happened to be working on the first Project and exploring non-BootStrap frameworks was part of the assignment. Ultimately I'm glad I still got a chance to expand my css repetroire. unfortunely I am still a little shaky on the Javascript side of this assigment.
